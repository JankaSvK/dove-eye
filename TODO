- most importantly create reliable object tracker
- save localization results to file and not stderr/stdout
- 3rd calibration step to obtain absolute position of cameras and orientation
- store intrinsic and pair calibration results separately
- make tracker selection in runtime, not compile time
- offline video processing
- video recording (concerned, isn't it mixing too much functionality?)
- time calibration (synchronization)
- RPM package for openSUSE (Tumbleweed?, Leap)
